    "In our previous simulation, we calculated the **correlation coefficient** between two states based on a **shared relational density function** in **MF Theory**. However, we encountered a result of **0.0000**, which indicated an issue with our choice of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon review, we found that the states used were **orthogonal**, resulting in a **zero dot product**. To address this, we have chosen **non-orthogonal states** to ensure a meaningful correlation coefficient.\n",
