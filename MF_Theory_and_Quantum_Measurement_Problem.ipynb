    "### ðŸ”¬ **Overview of the Quantum Measurement Problem**\n",
    "The quantum measurement problem has long puzzled physicists. In standard quantum mechanics, the wavefunction evolves deterministically according to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation until a measurement occurs, at which point it 'collapses' to a definite state. The question is: **What causes the collapse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In MF Theory, we propose that **relational density corrections** introduce an objective mechanism for wavefunction collapse, rooted in the underlying relational dynamics of the universe. Let's explore this idea."
