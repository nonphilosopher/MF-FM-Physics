    "## 📚 1. Introduction to Quantum Corrections in MF Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of **MF Physics**, **quantum corrections** refer to modifications of classical field dynamics due to quantum effects. These corrections are essential in understanding phenomena at very small scales, such as black hole horizons and early-universe singularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum corrections typically appear as additional terms in the **Lagrangian density** or **field equations**, accounting for effects like:\n",
    "- **Vacuum fluctuations**\n",
    "- **Renormalization**\n",
    "- **Anomalies**\n",
    "\n",
    "In MF Theory, the introduction of an **Imaginary Length (𝑖𝐿)** further modifies these corrections by incorporating **nonlocal effects**.\n",
