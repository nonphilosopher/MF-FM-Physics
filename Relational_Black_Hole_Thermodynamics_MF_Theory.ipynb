    "## üìú 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical physics, **black hole thermodynamics** is governed by the **Bekenstein-Hawking entropy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[S_{\text{BH}} = \f",
    "rac{k_B c^3}{4 \\hbar G} A,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( A \\) is the **area of the event horizon**. However, this classical formulation leaves unresolved questions, such as the **black hole information paradox** and the **nature of black hole microstates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, black hole thermodynamics can be reformulated using **relational entropy** and **topological corrections** introduced by the **Imaginary Length (ùëñùêø)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. The **reformulation of black hole entropy** using relational fields.\n",
    "2. The role of **topological invariants** in black hole thermodynamics.\n",
    "3. How **ùëñùêø corrections** address the **information paradox**.\n",

    "## üî¨ 2. Reformulating Black Hole Entropy with Relational Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the entropy of a black hole is not solely a function of its horizon area but includes **topological corrections**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[S_{\text{rel}}^{(\\chi)} = \f",
    "rac{k_B c^3}{4 \\hbar G} \\left(A + iL \\chi\r",

    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( A \\) is the **area of the event horizon**,\n",
    "- \\( iL \\) is the **Imaginary Length correction**,\n",
    "- \\( \\chi \\) is a **topological invariant** (e.g., Euler characteristic).\n",
    "\n",
    "This correction implies that **black hole entropy** contains information about the **topological structure** of spacetime.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© 3. Addressing the Black Hole Information Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The **information paradox** arises from the apparent loss of information when a black hole evaporates. In **MF Theory**, this paradox can be resolved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introducing relational entropy jumps during evaporation**.\n",
    "2. **Topological corrections preserving information across horizons**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Hawking Radiation Spectrum\n",
    "The **Hawking radiation spectrum** is modified by the **ùëñùêø correction**:\n",

    "Let's simulate how **black hole entropy evolves** with **ùëñùêø corrections** during evaporation and visualize the **entropy jumps**.\n",

    "- The **initial entropy** of a black hole.\n",
    "- The **entropy change** as the black hole evaporates.\n",
    "- The impact of **topological corrections** on the final entropy.\n"
