    "\n",
    "## üìú 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key predictions of **MF Theory** is that **time is not fundamental**. Instead, the **arrow of time** emerges from **relational entropy jumps** and **quantum collapses** in a stochastic process driven by the density of modal fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The concept of **Relational Entropy**.\n",
    "2. The role of **Topological Invariants** in field dynamics.\n",
    "3. The emergence of the **Arrow of Time** from entropy-driven processes.\n",
    "4. **Simulations** illustrating entropy evolution and time asymmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî¨ 2. Relational Entropy in MF Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical thermodynamics, entropy measures the **disorder** or **uncertainty** in a system. In **MF Theory**, **relational entropy** measures the **uncertainty in relational interactions** between fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relational entropy \\( S_{\text{rel}} \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[S_{\text{rel}} = - \\int \r",
    "ho(x) \\ln \r",
    "ho(x) \\, d^3x,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \r",
    "ho(x) \\) is the **relational density function**,\n",
    "- \\( d^3x \\) represents the spatial volume element.\n",
    "\n",
    "As fields interact and collapse, the relational density changes, causing **entropy jumps** that drive the **arrow of time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© 3. Topological Invariants and Entropy Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "In MF Theory, topological invariants such as the **Euler characteristic** \\( \\chi \\) and **Chern classes** appear as corrections to entropy bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corrected entropy bound is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[S_{\text{rel}}^{(\\chi)} = S_{\text{rel}} + iL \\chi,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( iL \\) is the **imaginary length correction**,\n",
    "- \\( \\chi \\) is a **topological invariant** of the spacetime manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This correction introduces **phase shifts** in entropy evolution, affecting the dynamics of fields.\n",

    "## üìê 4. Simulating Entropy Evolution and Time Asymmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simulate the evolution of relational entropy over time and visualize the emergence of time asymmetry driven by entropy jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the relational density function \\( \r",
    "ho(x, t) \\) and calculate the corresponding entropy evolution:\n",
