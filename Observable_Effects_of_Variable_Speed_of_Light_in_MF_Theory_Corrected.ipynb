    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the speed of light \\( c \\) is not a fixed constant but an **emergent property** dependent on the **relational density function** \\( \r",
    "ho(x, t) \\) and **topological corrections**. This implies that light can travel at different speeds through regions of varying **relational density**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores **practical, observable scenarios** in astrophysics where **variable light speed effects** could be detected with current technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on:\n",
    "1. **Light travel time delays** between regions with different relational densities.\n",
    "2. **Quasar time delays** caused by gravitational lensing through **galaxy clusters**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s simulate **time delays** between light traveling through:\n",
    "1. A **dense region** (e.g., near a black hole or galaxy cluster).\n",
    "2. A **void** or regular intergalactic space.\n",

    "- \\( \r",
    "ho(x, t) \\) is the **relational density function**,\n",

    "## ðŸ§© 3. Practical Scenario: Quasar Time Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "Quasars are bright, distant objects powered by **supermassive black holes**. When light from a quasar passes through a **gravitational lens** (e.g., a galaxy cluster), we observe **multiple images of the same quasar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to **variable light speed effects**, these images reach us at **different times**, causing a measurable **time delay**.\n",
