    "In classical physics, **space**, **time**, **mass**, and **spin** are considered **fundamental properties** of the universe. In **MF Theory**, however, these quantities are **emergent relational properties**, arising from **relational density interactions** and **topological corrections**.\n",

    "1. How **space** and **time** emerge from relational fields.\n",
    "2. How **mass** and **spin** are derived from **topological invariants**.\n",
    "3. How alternative **Hamiltonians** are constructed using **ùëñùêø corrections**.\n",
