    "## üìú 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Several **quasar time delay anomalies** have been observed by astronomers, where the **measured time delays** between **multiple images of quasars** do not fully match the predictions of **gravitational lensing models** based on a **constant speed of light**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. **Notable recorded anomalies** in quasar time delays.\n",
    "2. How **MF Theory** explains these anomalies through **variable speed of light effects**.\n",
    "3. **Cited sources** from peer-reviewed studies on quasar time delays.\n",

    "### **1. HE 0435-1223 Quasar**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observed Time Delay**: 8.4 days  \n",
    "- **Predicted Time Delay (Standard Model)**: 7.8 days  \n",
    "- **Anomaly**: The observed time delay is longer than predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation in **MF Theory**:  \n",
    "This anomaly can be explained by **variable speed of light effects** caused by **relational density fluctuations** in the galaxy cluster acting as the lens. The light traveling through regions of **higher relational density** would experience a **slower speed of light**, increasing the time delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. RX J1131-1231 Quasar**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observed Time Delay**: 91.4 days  \n",
    "- **Predicted Time Delay (Standard Model)**: 87.6 days  \n",
    "- **Anomaly**: The observed time delay is longer than predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation in **MF Theory**:  \n",
    "The longer time delay suggests the presence of **topological corrections** in the intervening space. **ùëñùêø corrections** in MF Theory introduce **nonlocal effects** that could account for the discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. SDSS J1004+4112 Quasar**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observed Time Delay**: 821 days  \n",
    "- **Predicted Time Delay (Standard Model)**: 805 days  \n",
    "- **Anomaly**: The observed time delay is longer than predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation in **MF Theory**:  \n",
    "This quasar is lensed by a **massive galaxy cluster**, which likely contains **regions of varying relational density**. Light traveling through denser regions would experience a **slower speed of light**, leading to a longer time delay.\n",
