    "The **Hubble tension** refers to the discrepancy between the value of the **Hubble constant \\( H_0 \\)** derived from **cosmic microwave background (CMB)** measurements and the value measured from **local observations**, such as **Type Ia supernovae**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how **MF Theory** resolves the Hubble tension through **relational density corrections** and **variable speed of light effects**.\n",

    "We will compare:\n",
    "1. **Hubble constant values from Planck and SH0ES measurements**.\n",
    "2. **Corrected Hubble constant values** using relational density corrections.\n",
