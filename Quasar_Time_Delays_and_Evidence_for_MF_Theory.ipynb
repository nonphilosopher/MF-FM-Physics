    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the speed of light \\( c \\) is an **emergent property** that depends on the **relational density function** \\( \r",
    "ho(x, t) \\) and **topological corrections**. This implies that light may travel at **different speeds** through regions of varying density, leading to **time delays** observable in astrophysical phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best opportunities to detect this effect is through **quasar time delays** caused by **gravitational lensing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. **Theoretical framework** for variable speed of light in MF Theory.\n",
    "2. **Practical scenarios** involving quasar time delays.\n",
    "3. **Observed anomalies** in quasar time delays that support MF Theory predictions.\n",
    "4. **Simulations** demonstrating time delays for light passing through different regions of space.\n",

    "## ðŸ”¬ 2. Quasar Time Delays: Theoretical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "When light from a distant **quasar** passes through a **gravitational lens** (such as a galaxy cluster), we observe **multiple images** of the same quasar. Due to the different paths light takes, each image arrives at a different time, creating a **time delay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **standard physics**, this time delay is calculated using the **lens equation**, assuming a **constant speed of light**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\\Delta t = \f",
    "rac{D_{\\Delta t}}{c} \\left(\f",
    "rac{1}{2} (\theta_i^2 - \theta_s^2) - \\psi(\theta_i)\r",
    "ight),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( D_{\\Delta t} \\) is the **time delay distance**,\n",
    "- \\( \theta_i \\) and \\( \theta_s \\) are the **image** and **source positions**,\n",
    "- \\( \\psi \\) is the **lens potential**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, however, the speed of light is not constant. It depends on the **relational density** and **nonlocal corrections**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[c'(x, t) = \\sqrt{\f",
    "rac{1}{\r",
    "ho(x, t)}} \\left(1 + iL \\chi(x, t)\r",
    "ight).\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces **variable time delays** that can be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§© 3. Practical Scenario: Quasar Time Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s simulate time delays for a quasar passing through:\n",
    "1. A **dense region** (e.g., a galaxy cluster).\n",
    "2. A **void** (low-density intergalactic space).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare:\n",
