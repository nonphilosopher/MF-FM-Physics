    "The nature of **dark matter** and **dark energy** is a major unsolved mystery in physics. There are two main hypotheses:\n",
    "1. **Particle-Based Model**: Dark matter is composed of unknown particles (e.g., WIMPs or axions).\n",
    "2. **Relational Density-Based Model**: Dark matter and dark energy are emergent effects of **relational fields** in **MF Theory**, without requiring new particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. **Model galaxy rotation curves** with and without dark matter particles.\n",
    "2. **Simulate time-varying dark energy** with relational corrections.\n",
    "3. **Compare predictions** from both models to observational data.\n",
    "4. **Propose experimental protocols** to distinguish between the two models.\n"
