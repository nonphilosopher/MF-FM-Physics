    "# ðŸ”— Local Roots of Nonlocality in MF Theory\n",

    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In **standard quantum mechanics**, entanglement is often described as a **nonlocal phenomenon**, where two entangled particles remain correlated regardless of the distance between them. This has led to the concept of **\"spooky action at a distance\"**, where changes to one particle's state instantaneously affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, however, **nonlocal correlations have a local root** in the **relational structure** of space-time. The apparent **nonlocality** is a manifestation of **conservation laws** in the **relational density field**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. How **entanglement** can be understood as a **relational conservation law**.\n",
    "2. How **nonlocal effects** emerge from **local roots** in **MF Theory**.\n",
    "3. A simulation of **local conservation laws** reproducing **entanglement correlations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¬ 2. Entanglement as a Relational Conservation\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, entangled particles are part of a **shared relational field**. The **correlations** between their states are a result of **initial relational configurations** that are **conserved** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s simulate this concept by calculating the **correlation between two particles** in a shared **relational field** and compare it to the predictions of **Bell inequalities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§© 3. Simulation: Local Roots of Nonlocal Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Generate **entangled states** from a **shared relational density function**.\n",
    "2. Calculate the **correlation coefficient** between the two particles.\n",
    "3. Show how **relational conservation laws** can reproduce **Bell inequality violations**.\n"
