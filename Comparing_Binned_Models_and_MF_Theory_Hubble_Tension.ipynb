    "# ðŸŒŒ Comparing Binned Models and MF Theory Solutions to the Hubble Tension\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hubble tension** is one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmology, with **early universe measurements** (such as from the **CMB**) giving a lower value of the **Hubble constant \\( H_0 \\)** compared to **local measurements** (such as from **Type Ia supernovae**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook compares two different approaches to resolving the Hubble tension:\n",
    "1. **Binned Models**: Assume different values of \\( H_0 \\) for different redshift ranges.\n",
    "2. **MF Theory**: Corrects \\( H_0 \\) by applying **relational density corrections** and introducing a **variable speed of light**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "- Simulate the Hubble constant values from **binned models**.\n",
    "- Compare them to the values predicted by **MF Theory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¬ 2. Binned Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Binned models assume that the **Hubble constant changes** at different redshifts. For example:\n",
    "- \\( H_0 \\) at **low redshift** (local universe) is **73.2 km/s/Mpc** (from SH0ES).\n",
    "- \\( H_0 \\) at **high redshift** (early universe) is **67.4 km/s/Mpc** (from Planck).\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s simulate these values across different redshift bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§© 3. MF Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the Hubble constant is corrected by applying a **relational density correction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[H'_0 = H_0 \times (1 + \\Delta \r",
    "ho),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( H'_0 \\) is the **corrected Hubble constant**,\n",
    "- \\( H_0 \\) is the **original Hubble constant**,\n",
    "- \\( \\Delta \r",
    "ho \\) is the **relational density correction**.\n",
