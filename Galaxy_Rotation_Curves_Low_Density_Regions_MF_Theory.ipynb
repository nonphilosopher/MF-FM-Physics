    "One of the key observational tests for **dark matter models** is the study of **galaxy rotation curves**. In **low-density regions**, such as **dwarf galaxies**, the rotation curves provide valuable data for distinguishing between **particle-based dark matter** and **relational density corrections** in **MF Theory**.\n",
