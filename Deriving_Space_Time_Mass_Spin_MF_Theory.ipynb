    "## üìú 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical physics, **space**, **time**, **mass**, and **spin** are considered **fundamental properties** of the universe. In **MF Theory**, however, these quantities are **emergent relational properties**, arising from **relational density interactions** and **topological corrections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. How **space** and **time** emerge from relational fields.\n",
    "2. How **mass** and **spin** are derived from **topological invariants**.\n",
    "3. How alternative **Hamiltonians** are constructed using **ùëñùêø corrections**.\n",
    "4. Simulations illustrating the emergence of these physical properties.\n",

    "## üî¨ 2. Space and Time as Emergent Relational Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, space and time do not exist independently. Instead, they emerge from **relational interactions** between fields. The **relational density function** \\( \r",
