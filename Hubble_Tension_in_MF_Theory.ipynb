    "\n",
    "The **Hubble tension** refers to the discrepancy between the **local measurements** of the **Hubble constant \\( H_0 \\)** and the value inferred from **cosmological observations** such as the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the speed of light \\( c \\) is not constant but an **emergent property** of the **relational density function**. This variable speed of light could explain the **Hubble tension** by introducing **relational density corrections** to the observed time delays in **quasar lensing systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. **Theoretical framework** for how MF Theory impacts the Hubble constant.\n",
    "2. **Simulations** of Hubble constant values derived from quasar time delays.\n",
    "3. **Comparison to observed anomalies** in quasar time delays and how MF Theory resolves the tension.\n",

    "- \\( v \\) is the **recession velocity**,\n",
    "- \\( d \\) is the **distance to the galaxy**.\n",

    "In **MF Theory**, the observed time delays in **gravitational lensing systems** can modify the calculation of the Hubble constant by introducing **relational density corrections**:\n",
