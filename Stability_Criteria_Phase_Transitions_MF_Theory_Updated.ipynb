    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, stability and phase transitions are governed by the **relational density function** and **topological corrections** introduced by the **Imaginary Length (ùëñùêø)**. This notebook explores:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **stability criteria** for relational fields.\n",
    "2. The role of **ùëñùêø corrections** in **critical phenomena**.\n",
    "3. How **topological invariants** influence **phase transitions** in complex systems.\n",

    "## üî¨ 2. Stability Criteria in Relational Field Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability of a relational field depends on the **curvature of the relational density function** \\( \r",
    "ho(x) \\) and its interaction with **ùëñùêø corrections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability condition can be expressed as:\n",

    "\\[\f",
    "rac{d^2 S_{\text{rel}}}{dx^2} > 0,\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "\n",
    "Phase transitions occur when a system passes through a **critical point**, where the stability of the relational field changes.\n",

    "### Types of Phase Transitions:\n",
    "1. **First-Order Phase Transitions**:  \n",
    "   - Discontinuous changes in relational density.  \n",
    "   - Example: Sudden collapse of a relational field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second-Order Phase Transitions**:  \n",
    "   - Continuous changes in relational density, with critical fluctuations.  \n",
