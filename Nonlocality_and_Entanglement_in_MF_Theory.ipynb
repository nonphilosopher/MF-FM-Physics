    "\n",
    "In standard quantum mechanics, **nonlocality** refers to the **instantaneous correlations** observed between **entangled particles**, regardless of the distance between them. These correlations cannot be explained by **classical local hidden variable theories**, as shown by the violation of **Bell inequalities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, nonlocality is a **natural consequence** of the underlying **relational density functions** and **topological corrections** introduced by **\\( iL \\)**. Nonlocal effects are not mysterious; they emerge from the **relational structure** of space-time itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores:\n",
    "1. How **nonlocality** arises in **MF Theory**.\n",
    "2. The role of **relational density corrections** in **entanglement**.\n",
    "3. Simulations of **entanglement entropy** with **nonlocal corrections**.\n",

    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, the **wavefunction** of a quantum system can be modified to include **nonlocal terms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\\Psi(x, t) = \\Psi_0(x, t) \times (1 + iL \\chi(x, t)),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\Psi_0(x, t) \\) is the **standard wavefunction**,\n",
    "- \\( iL \\) is the **imaginary length correction**,\n",
    "- \\( \\chi(x, t) \\) is a **topological invariant** representing **relational density corrections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These **nonlocal terms** introduce **long-range correlations** in quantum systems, leading to modifications in **entanglement entropy**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs calculate the **entanglement entropy** of a simple **two-particle system** with and without **MF Theory corrections**.\n",
