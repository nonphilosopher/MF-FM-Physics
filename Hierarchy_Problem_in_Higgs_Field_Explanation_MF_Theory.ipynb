    "## ðŸ§© **1. Why the Hierarchy Problem Arises in QFT**\n",
    "In **QFT (Quantum Field Theory)**, the Higgs mass receives **quadratic quantum corrections** from interactions with other particles, which grow rapidly with energy scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the problem that the Higgs mass should naturally be driven to the **Planck scale (~$10^{19}$ GeV)**, unless finely tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corrected Higgs mass can be expressed as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "m_H^2 = m_H^2(\\text{bare}) + \\sum_{i} C_i \\Lambda^2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( m_H(\\text{bare}) \\) is the 'natural' Higgs mass without corrections.\n",
    "- \\( C_i \\) are coupling constants for each particle interacting with the Higgs.\n",
    "- \\( \\Lambda \\) is the energy cutoff (often taken as the Planck scale)."
