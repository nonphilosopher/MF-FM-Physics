    "The **cosmological constant problem** is one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. It arises from the discrepancy between the **observed value** of the cosmological constant (\\( \\Lambda \\)) and the **predicted value** from quantum field theory, which is off by **120 orders of magnitude**.\n",
