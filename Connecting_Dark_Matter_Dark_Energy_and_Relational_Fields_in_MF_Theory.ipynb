    "One of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology is the nature of **dark matter** and **dark energy**. In **ŒõCDM cosmology**, dark matter is an unknown form of matter that explains **galaxy rotation curves**, and dark energy is a **repulsive force** responsible for the **accelerating expansion of the universe**.\n",

    "1. Explore how **relational fields** can explain **galaxy rotation curves**.\n",
    "2. Model how **time-varying dark energy** arises from **relational density corrections**.\n",
    "3. Simulate the **evolution of the cosmic expansion rate** with relational corrections.\n"
