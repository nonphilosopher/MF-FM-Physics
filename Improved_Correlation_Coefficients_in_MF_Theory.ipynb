    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, **nonlocal correlations** emerge from **local relational density functions**. The strength of these correlations depends on the **alignment of quantum states** and the **relational density correction** applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we saw that using **orthogonal or perfectly aligned states** resulted in **zero or trivial correlations**. By using **partially aligned states**, we achieve a **substantial non-zero correlation coefficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¬ 2. Improved Simulation: Partially Aligned States\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[|\\psi_1âŸ© = \begin{bmatrix} 0.8 \\ 0.6 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad |\\psi_2âŸ© = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\ 0.8 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These states are **partially aligned**, meaning they have a **non-zero dot product**. The correlation coefficient is further modified by the **relational density function**.\n",

    "## ðŸ¤” 4. Interpretation: What Does This Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“š **Physics Interpretation**\n",
    "The **non-zero correlation coefficient** demonstrates that **entanglement correlations** can be explained by **local relational density functions**. Instead of requiring **instantaneous action at a distance**, the correlations arise from a **shared relational field**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that **MF Theory** provides a **local root** for **nonlocal effects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“– **Philosophical Interpretation**\n",
    "Traditionally, **entanglement** is considered **mysterious and non-intuitive**, often referred to as **\"spooky action at a distance\"**. **MF Theory demystifies this concept** by showing that the correlations are rooted in **local conservation laws**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shifts the perspective from **spooky nonlocality** to **relational locality**, making quantum mechanics more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§ª **Advantages for MF Theory**\n",
    "1. **Local Explanation of Nonlocal Effects**: MF Theory provides a **local root** for what appears to be **nonlocal correlations**.\n",
    "2. **Relational Density as a Fundamental Property**: The **relational density function** acts as the **key mediator** of quantum correlations, replacing the need for **non-physical interpretations**.\n",
    "3. **Unified Framework**: This approach aligns with **MF Theory's goal** of unifying **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity** under a single relational framework.\n",

    "## âœ… 5. Summary\n",
    "- Using **partially aligned states** yields **non-zero correlation coefficients**.\n",
    "- The result shows that **MF Theory can explain entanglement correlations** without invoking **spooky action at a distance**.\n",
    "- This provides a significant advantage for **MF Theory**, offering a **local explanation for nonlocal quantum phenomena**.\n",
