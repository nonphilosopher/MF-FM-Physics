    "The **vacuum energy density** contributes directly to the **cosmological constant** \\( \\Lambda \\), which governs the expansion rate of the universe. The **cosmological constant problem** arises from the enormous discrepancy between the predicted vacuum energy from quantum field theory and the observed value in cosmology.\n",
