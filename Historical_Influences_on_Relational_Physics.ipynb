    "\n",
    "**Ernst Mach (1838-1916)** argued that **inertia is a relational property**, determined by the **distribution of matter in the universe**. According to Mach's principle, the **inertial properties of an object** are not inherent but arise from its **relations to other objects**.\n",

    "This idea had a profound influence on **Albert Einstein** and the development of **General Relativity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mach’s Principle** can be summarized as:\n",
    "- **Inertia is Relational**: The motion of an object is determined by its **relation to other objects** in the universe.\n",
    "- **No Absolute Space**: Mach argued against the idea of **absolute space and time**, which were central to Newtonian physics.\n",
