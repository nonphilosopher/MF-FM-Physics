    "**Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)** are solutions to Einstein's field equations that allow for **loops in spacetime**, where an object can return to its own past. These loops create **causal paradoxes**, such as the **grandfather paradox**, where an event could prevent its own cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in **MF Theory**, CTCs can be **self-consistent** due to **relational density constraints**. These constraints ensure that causal loops do not violate physical laws but instead create **feedback loops** governed by **relational corrections**.\n",
