    "## ðŸ“œ 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum information theory** studies how **quantum systems** store, transfer, and process information. Unlike classical information, **quantum information** relies on **superpositions**, **entanglement**, and **nonlocal correlations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, quantum information is understood as a **relational property** that depends on the **relational density** between systems. This has profound implications for understanding **quantum decoherence**, the process by which **quantum systems lose coherence** and appear classical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¬ 2. Relational Density and Quantum Decoherence\n",
    "\n",
    "In **standard quantum mechanics**, **decoherence** occurs when a quantum system interacts with its environment, causing the system to lose its superposition state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MF Theory**, decoherence is influenced by **relational density fluctuations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\\rho(x, t) = \\rho_0 \times (1 + iL \\chi(x, t)),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\rho_0 \\) is the **base density function**,\n",
    "- \\( iL \\) is the **imaginary length correction**,\n",
    "- \\( \\chi(x, t) \\) is a **topological invariant**.\n",

    "## ðŸ§© 3. Simulation: Quantum State Evolution with Relational Density Corrections\n",

    "We will simulate how a quantum state evolves over time with and without relational density corrections, observing the effects on **decoherence**.\n"
